               <h2>About Us</h2>
               <p>
                  Sean & Gia have been dating for some time now. 
                  They're crazy about being in eachother's company all the time. 
                  And also even crazier about animals.... well... she is a tad bit more. 
                  They frequently spend time with family and friends whether its family get-togethers or lounging around the house. 
                  Both enjoy snowboarding in the winters , and traveling to upstate NY in the summers.
                  Avid country music listeners ... so we all know country music = TAILGATES & CONCERTS.
                  Recently they have been thinking that a dog would only heighten all of their experiences.
                  But they can't deceide on what breed of dog they want. Hopefully this list will help break down each dog in the running.
